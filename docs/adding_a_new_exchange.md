# Adding a new exchange to the Dcxt Library.

## Introduction

The purpose of the Dcxt library is to provide a common interface for interacting with various cryptocurrency exchanges. This document will guide you through the process of adding a new exchange to the Dcxt library.

## Steps

### Step 1: Create a new file

### Step 2: Edit the `__init__.py` file

### Step 3: Implement the exchange class

### Step 4: Resolve any failing tests.

Create a new file in the `packages/eightballer/connections/dcxt/dcxt` directory. The file should be named after the exchange you are adding. 

For example, if you are adding the balancer exchange, the file should be named `balancer.py`.

We need to first edit the file `packages/eightballer/connections/dcxt/dcxt/__init__.py`
